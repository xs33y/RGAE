## Introduction
we propose a regularized graph auto-encoders (RGAE) model, committed to utilizing abundant information in multiple views to learn robust network representations. More specifically, RGAE designs shared and private graph auto-encoders as main components to capture high-order nonlinear structure information of the networks. Besides, two loss functions serve as regularization to extract consistent and unique information, respectively.
